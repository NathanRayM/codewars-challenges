/*
In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Tested years are in range 1600 ≤ year ≤ 4000.
*/

function isLeapYear(year) {
  return (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0;
}

console.log(isLeapYear(2020)); // Output: true
console.log(isLeapYear(2000)); // Output: true
console.log(isLeapYear(2015)); // Output: false
console.log(isLeapYear(2100)); // Output: false
